## Branching

```ebnf
<comptime_branch> ::=
    "comptime" (
        | <if_else_if_branch>
        | <if_match>
        | <match>
        | <ternary>
    ) ;
```

Dependencies:

- [`<if_else_if_branch>`](../control-flow/branching.md#if-else-if)
- [`<if_match>`](../control-flow/branching.md#if-match)
- [`<match>`](../control-flow/branching.md#match)
- [`<ternary>`](../control-flow/branching.md#ternary)

The `<comptime_branch>` is a branch that is evaluated at compile time where only the truthy branch
is compiled. It is defined as the "comptime" keyword followed by any of the branches.

### Semantics

Since `comptime` must be resolved at compile time, the branching expression must be resolvable at
compile time and of type `bool`. That is to say the expression must itself be a literal, constant,
or another expression resolvable at compile time.

In the case of compile time branching, branches that are not matched will be removed from the code
at compile time.

```rs
use std::{
    builtin::HardFork,
    op::{tstore, tload, sstore, sload},
};

const LOCK_SLOT: u256 = keccak256("mutex").into() - 1;

enum Lock {
    Locked,
    Unlocked,
}

fn reader() -> (u256 -> u256) {
    match @hardFork() {
        HardFork::Cancun => tload,
        _ => sload,
    }
}

fn writer() -> ((u256, u256) -> ()) {
    match @hardFork() {
        HardFork::Cancun => tstore,
        _ => sstore,
    }
}

fn nonreentrant(action: T -> U) {
    if reader()(LOCK_SLOT) matches Lock::Locked {
        revert();
    }
    writer()(LOCK_SLOT, Lock::Locked);
    let res = action();
    writer()(LOCK_SLOT, Lock::Unlocked);
    return res;
}
```
