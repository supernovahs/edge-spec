## Functions

```ebnf
<comptime_function> ::= "comptime" <function_assignment> ;
```

Dependencies:

- [`<function_assignment>`](../type-system/function-types.md#assignment)

The `<comptime_function>` is a function that is evaluated at compile time. It is defined as the
"comptime" keyword followed by a `<function_assignment>`.

### Semantics

Since `comptime` must be resolved at compile time, the function must contain only expressions
resolvable at compile time.

```rs
comptime fn a() -> u8 {
    1
}

comptime fn b(arg: u8) -> u8 {
    arg * 2
}

comptime fn c(arg: u8) -> u8 {
    a(b(arg))
}

const A = c(1);
const B = c(A);
```
