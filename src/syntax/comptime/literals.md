## Literals

### Characters

```ebnf
<bin_char> ::= "0" | "1" ;
<dec_char> ::= "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9" ;
<hex_char> ::=
    | "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9" | "a"
    | "b" | "c" | "d" | "e" | "f" | "A" | "B" | "C" | "D" | "E" | "F";
<alpha_char> ::=
    | "a" | "b" | "c" | "d" | "e" | "f" | "g" | "h" | "i" | "j" | "k" | "l" | "m" | "n" | "o" | "p"
    | "q" | "r" | "s" | "t" | "u" | "v" | "w" | "x" | "y" | "z" ;
<alphanumeric_char> ::= <alpha_char> | <dec_char> ;

<unicode_char> ::= ? "i ain't writing all that. happy for you tho. or sorry that happened" ? ;
```

### Numeric

```ebnf
<bin_literal> ::= { "0b" (<bin_char> | "_")+ [<numeric_type>]} ;
<dec_literal> ::= { (<dec_char> | "_")+ [<numeric_type>]} ;
<hex_literal> ::= { "0x" (<hex_char> | "_")+ [<numeric_type>]} ;

<numeric_literal> ::= <bin_literal> | <dec_literal> | <hex_literal> ;
```

Numeric literals are composed of binary, decimal, and hexadecimal digits. Each digit may contain
an arbitrary number of underscore characters in them and may be suffixed with a numeric type.

Binary literals are prefixed with `0b` and hexadecimal literals are prefixed with `0x`.

### String

```ebnf
<string_literal> ::= { '"' (!'"' <unicode_char>)* '"' } | { "'" (!"'" <unicode_char>)* "'" };
```

String literals contain alphanumeric characters delimited by double or single quotes.

### Boolean

```ebnf
<boolean_literal> ::= "true" | "false" ;
```

Boolean literals may be either "true" or "false".

### Literal

```ebnf
<literal> ::= <numeric_literal> | <string_literal> | <boolean_literal> ;
```

### Semantics

Numeric literals may contain arbitrary underscores in the same literal. Numeric literals may also be
suffixed with the numeric type to constrain its type. If there is no type suffix, the type is
inferred by the context. If a type cannot be inferred, it will default to a `u256`.

Both numeric and boolean literals are roughly translated to pushing the value onto the stack.

String literals represent string instantiation. String instantiation behaves as a packed `u8`
[array instantiation](../type-system/array-types.md#instantiation).

```rs
const A = 1;
const B = 1u8;
const C = 0b11001100;
const D = 0xffFFff;
const E = true;
const F = "asdf";
const G = "ðŸ’©";
```
